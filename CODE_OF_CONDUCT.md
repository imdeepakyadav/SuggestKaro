## Our Standards

We encourage and expect positive behavior from all community members, including:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (including but not limited to issue trackers, pull requests, and comments), and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [work.deepak.yadav@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the project without warning.
